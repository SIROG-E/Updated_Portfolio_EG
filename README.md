## Review

When compared to the original, it looks pretty similar to the one provided. Links navigate to the locations they are supposed to. I had trouble adding the background picture. It worked from the beginning, but somehow it broke later. Same thing happened with the sticky footer. For this homework, I tried adding more comments.
